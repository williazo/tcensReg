#' Log Likelihood for Model for J independent Truncated Normal Variables with Same Mean Structure but Different Variance
#'
#' This function is part of the supporting function space to calculate the value of the log-likelihood at the nth iteration of theta.
#' For this parametrization we assume that there exists (p-1) linear parameters for the mean and J separate variance parameters
